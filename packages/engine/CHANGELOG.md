### Patch Changes

- 2d0128c: Add the privileged Chat attachment-admission contract and durable queued-Message attachment identities.
- b38ae00: User-facing: Coach answers can now offer a safe Continue in Plan card, resolve Workout date conflicts, retry failed handoffs without duplicates, and recover a Proposal when a local Plan save fails.

  Chat keeps typed Plan handoffs with their transcript turn, while Plan protects athlete-created Workouts and requires review before applying a new date or replacing a coach-owned Workout.

- 8c20aef: User-facing: Workout handoffs from Chat now open the same reviewable Plan Proposal after retries or relaunch, while Draft and Plan-creation requests continue in their exact Plan conversation.

  Planning stores the destination artifact and request relation together, preserves date conflicts for review, and keeps delivery retryable when destination intake is temporarily unavailable.

- dc24ae3: User-facing: Applying or rejecting a Chat-originated Plan Proposal now records the matching Chat result atomically, so relaunch cannot show a stale or contradictory handoff.

  Planning keeps revised Proposals attached to their originating request, rolls back the complete Plan change when terminal-result storage fails, and leaves calendar mirroring separate from local success.

- 1e07590: User-facing: Queued messages with only an attachment now keep that attachment when retried after reopening Chat.
- 3627ecd: Retain unsummarized conversation history after compaction failures and stop when it cannot safely fit.

  User-facing: If a conversation summary fails, the coach keeps the original context or asks you to try again instead of silently forgetting earlier goals and corrections.

- c507634: End an active Plan locally before removing tomorrow-onward Plan-owned Intervals workouts, with durable retry and verify-only recovery that preserves today and athlete-created events.
- e649a25: Add display-only Estimated CP from two eligible recent measured-power efforts, including stale and unavailable states, an explanatory tooltip, evidence and route-assumption drawers, and strict isolation from FTP and Plan mutations.
- f6cacbb: Add forward-only race-readiness projections, explicit unavailable and changed-assumption states, refresh recovery, and taper safety refusal without mutating the active Plan.
- b02a1e8: User-facing: Plans now end automatically after their final date and let athletes record the race as Completed or Not completed without changing their saved Plan.
- b87174d: Replace an active Plan atomically while preserving today, verify tomorrow-onward cleanup of the old Plan before writing the replacement’s next seven days, and keep failures recoverable after relaunch.
- 3ad0c39: Show every active Plan week with phase, purpose, status, and planned time, plus a complete authoritative race-week schedule with separate training, race, and total accounting.
- a52086c: Add Plan-scoped settings with immediate persistence and safely auto-apply eligible future workout duration reductions.
- 6546ba5: User-facing: Active Plans can now show one automatic, score-free review of the latest completed week after a successful sync.
- 1594b20: Retire prompt instructions written for earlier models: remove the completed memory-section migration clause from the flush prompt, drop two redundant conduct rules and a numeric bullet cap from the cycling soul, soften two shouting registers, and give plan_save a real tool contract. Also drop the retired `.ralph/` gitignore entry.
- a5a366f: User-facing: Stopping a Chat response or losing connection now keeps the interrupted message retryable and sends later queued messages once, in order.
- eba82b9: User-facing: Chat recovery now survives repeated connection losses without duplicating your message after relaunch, while preserving every partial and completed Coach response.
- 2567965: User-facing: Plan coach conversations now collect durable training inputs, show a reviewable summary, and create a complete structured Draft before anything can activate or reach the Intervals calendar.

  The Plan composer stays at the bottom, optional Race Course attachment lives inside it, and interrupted intake saves recover from the conversation after relaunch.

- a415177: Add the internal training-history contract, persisted coverage evidence, calendar-aware capture plan, and state composition wiring.
- 3627ecd: Prepare explicit Astra selection on the public OpenAI API while retaining existing default models and restricting unverified subscription transports.

  User-facing: You can explicitly choose Astra with an OpenAI API key. Existing model choices stay unchanged, and unavailable cost estimates are not shown as known prices.
